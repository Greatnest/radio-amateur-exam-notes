# 13A. Band Planning

## Definitions

- **Bandwidth** is the amount of frequency band that is required for each transmission
- **Beacons** are specially licensed unattended transmitters that radiate a continuous signal to assist with checking of signal propagation 
- **Channelised** means that transmissions take place on specific frequencies or channels
- **S (Simplex)** is the normal method of Amateur communication where both stations transmit, one at a time on a single frequency
- **R (Repeaters)** are stations that re-transmit a received signal on a different frequency so as to allow further coverage of the transmission.
- **Calling frequencies** are designated frequencies to establish initial contact

## Notes

#### Suggested bands

| Transmission | Frequency |
| --- | ---
| Continuous Wave (Morse) | bottom 100 kHz (i.e. 3.5-3.6 MHz)
| RTTY (Teleprinters) | 3.6 MHz (3.59-3.62 MHz)
| SSB (speech) | 3.6-3.9 MHz
| SSTV (Slow Scan Television) | usually found about 235 kHz from the bottom of the band (i.e. 3.735 MHz)
| Long distance (DX) CW communication | bottom 10 kHz of 80 Metres (3.50-3.51 MHz)
| Long distance SSB communication | top 10 kHz of 80 Metres (3.79-3.90 MHz)
| Simplex | - **S10 - S23** use `25 Khz` spaced frequencies from `145.250 MHz` to `145.575 MHz` <br> - followed by the repeater outputs **RO - R7** on `25 KHz` spaced frequencies between `145.6 MHz` to `145.9 MHz`
| Repeater | - **R0** is at `145 MHz` <br> - **R1 - R8** is at `25 KHz` intervals from `145.025 MHz` to `145.200 MHz`

*The various types of transmission are given nominal segments so that you know where to 'look' for your particular interest*

#### 2 Meter Bands

| Type | Bandwidth
| --- | ---
| CW sector | bottom `150 KHz` (`144 MHz` - `144.15 MHz`)
| SSB speech | `144.15 MHz` - `144.5 MHz`
| open all modes | `144.5 MHz` - `144.9 MHz`

#### S and R Channels

- use FM (frequency modulation)
- top of this band Is used for satellite communication
- like frequencies on the lower half of this band is not channelised

#### Further Band Planning

| Frequency | Usage
| --- | ---
| `144.01 MHz` | Moon bouncing
| `144.05 MHz` | CW calling frequency
| `144.3 MHz` | SSB calling frequency
| `144.5 MHz` | SSTU
| `144.6 MHz` | RTTY
| `145.3 MHz` | s12
| `145.5 MHz` | 520

#### Calling frequency

- `40m` amateur bands can very busy
- `2m` and `10m` can be very quiet at times due to propagation or geographical difficulties
- it is prudent to call on this calling frequency
- as soon as two way communication has been established one of the stations should ask the other to stand-by
- look for a clear frequency
  - ascertained that the frequency is not already busy by enquiring "Is this frequency in use please?"
  - many circumstances where only one side of a conversation may be audible
  - you may (unwittingly) be interfering with another conversation
- then return to the calling frequency and suggest they change frequency to that chosen frequency

#### Compulsory

- Self-imposed band planning works well most of the time
- But, there might be odd cases who will decide to talk in the middle of the CW sector
- They maintain there's nothing in the license saying they should / should not be inside the band
