# 4. Alternating Current

## Definitions

- **Capacitance** is the stored charge between 2 metal plates
- **Dielectric** is the insulated barrier separating 2 plates in a capacitor
- **Fleming’s Left Hand Rule**: When a *current* is passed through a coil in a magnetic field, a force acts on the coil to try and make it turn
- **Fleming’s Right Hand Rule**: If a *conductor* is moved through a magnetic field an electric current will be generated
- **Amplitude** is the height of a waveform
- **Peak** value of a waveform is the maximum positive or negative value
- **Peak to peak** value is the difference between the maximum positive and maximum negative value. It is normally twice the peak value.
- **RMS (root mean square)** is the equivalent D.C. current or voltage that would produce the same heating effect as the A.C. waveform
- **Out of phase** waveforms have the same frequency but start at different times
- **In phase** waveforms have the same frequency and start at the same time
- **Capacitive reactance** is a measure of a capacitor's *opposition* to AC
- **Inductive reactance** is a measure of an inductor's *opposition* to AC
- **Resonant frequency** is the frequency at which the inductive reactance is equal and opposite to capacitive reactance in a series tuned circuit
- **Magnification / Q Factor** is the ratio of the voltage across the inductor (or capacitor) to the supply voltage at resonance
- **Bandwidth of a selectivity curve** is the frequency range where the output is at least 0.707 of the maximum value
- **Filter** is a circuit that will pass some frequencies and reject others

## Notes

### Capacitance

- 2 metals are connected by battery
- Plate "B" is now negatively charged and repels so strongly that the current ceases
- The plates have a  very  small capacitance for the storage of electricity
- Very important to  have  insulation  (dielectric) between the plates that will stand up to the voltage that is to be used

Capacitance of a capacitor is:

- `∝` area of the plates
- `1/∝` (inversely proportional) distance between the 2 plates
- `∝` permittivity of the dielectric between the plates

| Material  | Permittivity |
| ----- | ----- |
| Air  | 1  |
| Dry paper | 2.5  |
| Glass | 5  |
| Mica | 7  |

### Construction of capacitors

1. Paper capacitors
  - "sandwich” of strips of foil and wax impregnated paper
  - 2 foil forms the plates
  - waxed paper is the dielectric
- Mica capacitor
  - alternate layers of  thin  metal sheet
  - thin layers of mica as dielectric
- Silvered mica
  - Silver is  sprayed  on the sheets of mica to form the plates
  - advantages:
    - possible to make these capacitors very accurately
    - value of the capacitance  changes very little  with  wide temperature changes
  - E.g. suitable for the tuned circuits in oscillators
- Ceramic capacitors
  - small  pieces  of  ceramic that have a coating  of silver on each side
  - E.g. suitable for de-coupling
  - disadvantages
    - large  capacitance  variations  with changes of temperature
    - should not be used for tuned circuits
- Electrolytic Capacitors
  - two  aluminum  foil  strips
  - interleaved with an absorbent paper strip and wound  very tightly into a cylinder
  - one  capacitor  plate is one of the foil strips and the other  plate  is the electrolyte
  - the oxide acting  as the insulating dielectric
  - !! very important to ensure that electrolytic capacitors are connected right way round in any circuit
- Variable capacitors (tuning capacitors)
  - one set of fixed plates and one set of moving plates
  - dielectric is usually air
  - When the plates are rotated they overlap, and hence the capacitance, changes

### Alternating Current

- Generator
  - has a coil that continues to rotate in the same direction
  - produces electricity that flows in one direction for half a revolution and reverses in the next half cycle
  - current and voltage are in sine-wave

### Capacitance

- When a voltage is applied to a capacitor the initial charge *current is high* at a time when the *voltage is small*
- In a capacitive circuit:
  - current *leads* the voltage by 90°
  - voltage *lags* the current by 90°

### Inductance

- In an inductor, voltage *leads* the current by 90°

### RLC Circuit

| | Series  | Parallel |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Voltage across each component | calculate  | same |
| Current across each component | same  | calculate |
| R (resistor) | resistance in phase with voltage | resistance in phase with voltage |
| response curve resonant frequency | at minimum resistance  | at maximum resistance |
| resonant frequency circuit | acceptor circuit  | rejector circuit |

*Tuned circuits are used in oscillators and radio receivers. They can be used to select one frequency when many are present.*

#### Selectivity

- A high Q circuit has good selectivity of frequencies
- A low Q circuit has poor selectivity of frequencies
- Parallel tuned circuit would typically have a `Q` of `50`
